# 0Tea_deCypher_Kit
Blender, access to module command with ease.

Easy access for additional modules.  Mathutils and Bmesh module support is included.  Instructions on how to add support for any modules are commented along side an example of Numpy module.

This menu is accessible from all windows in Blender.

bpy.context is respected.
Though, any command manually entered from the console will limit the context to the console itself.
Context sensitive commands to be converted into actual executeble commands inside the console is on the todo list.

Default short-cut/hotkey:  Ctrl + W.

Happy Blending.
